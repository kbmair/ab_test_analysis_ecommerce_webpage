📊 Driving Business Decisions with Data: A/B Testing & Bootstrapping for Conversion Optimization
This repository contains the analysis and code behind the article "Driving Business Decisions with Data", which explores how A/B testing and bootstrapping can be used to make data-driven decisions in digital product environments.

Using simulated real-world data from Udacity’s "Analyze A/B Test Results" project, the study compares conversion outcomes between a control group (original website) and a treatment group (new website feature) to determine whether a new feature improves user engagement.

🔍 Key Highlights
Exploratory data analysis of control vs. treatment groups

Probability and conditional probability insights

Bootstrapping to simulate sampling distribution

Hypothesis testing with a 95% confidence interval

P-value simulation to determine statistical significance

Recommendation based on statistical and practical significance

📈 Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates strong statistical evidence (95% CI: 4.5%–5.5%, p ≈ 0) that the new website version significantly improves user conversion rates. As a result, the recommendation is to implement the updated feature sitewide.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

Jupyter Notebook

Bootstrapping for statistical inference
